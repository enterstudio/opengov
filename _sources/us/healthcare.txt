Challenges
============

Conflict of Interest
----------------------
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest

Data Interchange
------------------
* Billing

  * Who is going to pay for this?

* Medical Records

  * How many times do we need to collect this information?

Medical Loss Ratio
--------------------
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_ratio#Medical_Loss_Ratio

* % of costs spent on other areas (administration, *advertising*,
  profit) ("overhead")

* "Do we really spend a third of health care dollars
  on billing and bureaucracy?" 
  http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2012/may/11/jennifer-williamson/do-we-really-spend-nearly-third-health-care-dollar/

  .. epigraph:: 
    
      [...] the average medical loss ratio in the United States
      is about 80 percent. But the reason this study tacks on
      another 11 percent is that the medical loss ratio
      "does not take into account the cost of physicians
      to collect from insurance companies."


* PPACA Medical Loss Ratio limit: 85%/80%

Preventative Care
-------------------
The longer one waits to address a health concern,
the more likely it is that it will be more costly.

Or, it's less expensive for everyone to
be proactive about our health.
